🐍 Python – From Beginner to Intermediate

This repository brings together all my early pure Python projects, created without external libraries.
It represents my progression through the language, covering fundamental and intermediate concepts, each reinforced through practical coding exercises.

📘 Concepts Learned

Below are all the topics I studied and applied throughout my initial projects:

🔹 Language Fundamentals

    Variables and data types

    Input and output (input, print)

    Type casting (int, float, str, etc.)

🔹 Control Structures

    if, elif, else

    while loops

    for loops

    Flow control: break, continue

🔹 Functions

    Declaring functions with def

    Parameters and arguments

    Return values

    Variable scope (local/global)

🔹 Data Structures

    Lists

    Indexing

    Common methods (append, remove, etc.)

    Dictionaries

    Key–value pairs

    Common methods (items, keys, etc.)

🔹 Comprehensions

    List Comprehension

    Dictionary Comprehension

    Using conditions and nested loops inside comprehensions

🔹 Random Value Generation

    Basic use of the random module

    random.randint()

    random.choice()
